    <hr />
    <h3>1. Data Collection</h3>
    <p>Our developer has explicitly informed us that the Extension does not collect, store, or process any personal data or usage information. All operations performed by the Extension, including the generation of random passwords, are executed locally on your device without transmitting any data to external servers.</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>2. Data Usage</h3>
    <p>Since no data is collected:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No Personal Data is Used:</strong> The Extensionâ€™s functionality is solely to generate random passwords and does not involve data processing beyond that.</li>
      <li><strong>Limited Functionality:</strong> The Extension is designed to perform its primary function without tracking or profiling users.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h3>3. Data Sharing</h3>
    <p>We maintain a strict policy regarding your data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No Third-Party Sales or Transfers:</strong> Your data is not sold, shared, or transferred to any third parties, except in cases authorized by law.</li>
      <li><strong>Authorized Disclosures:</strong> In the rare event that disclosure is required by legal obligations (such as a court order), only the necessary information would be disclosed. However, as no data is collected by the Extension, this scenario does not apply.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h3>4. Data Security</h3>
    <p>While the Extension does not collect or store any information, we recommend:</p>
    <ul>

    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h3>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. When such changes occur:</p>
